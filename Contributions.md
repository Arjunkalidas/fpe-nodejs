# Contribute

## How to contribute?

If it is a feature request, please discuss with us as we have certain defined roadmap and some of the new suggestions may not be priority right now. But if the feature is viable and adds significant value immediately to the consumer, we will bump it up to the top of the backlog.


## Steps to create a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository and switch to the `develop` branch
3. Make your changes, and pull the latest changes from `develop` before pushing
4. Checkout to a topic branch out of the `develop` branch
5. Commit your code and please add a sensible title to the PR
6. Please add a short description of the changes as bullet points
7. Push your changes and send a PR
8. We'll review the code and get back to you with comments if any as soon as possible
9. If the code is good to go, it'll be merged
