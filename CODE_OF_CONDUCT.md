# Code of Conduct

## Our Purpose

A primary goal of FPE-NODEJS community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in FPE-NODEJS community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open [Source/Culture/Tech]

A short and long term goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase openness in the true sense of the word by encouraging participants to recognize and hold the community memebers accountable for their actions, i.e., contributions. Communities/repositories like these help developers and tech professionals learn, understand and implement encryption as part of their projects 

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
